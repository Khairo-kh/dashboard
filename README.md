## Personal Dashboard

Simple personal dashboard with personal information widget, weather widget, and a todo app.

## Brief description

The application uses react with `vite`. The reason form choosing vite and not using `create-react-app` is mainly because `create-react-app` is deprecated and not maintained anymore.
The project uses `Context API` for easy and robust state management, `styled-components` for styling and `TypeScript`. The application is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

## Setup and installation

- Add the open weather API key in the `.env.example` file and rename it to .env
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) depending on your operating system then install yarn using `npm install --global yarn`
- Install the project dependencies with yarn
- Run the application with `yarn dev` then you should be able to access it on localhost:5173
